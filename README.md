# Overview

This project is bootstrapped using [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate), an opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

We have improved it for front-end development in our Agency Revolution

# Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/agencyrevolution/ar-ng-boilerplate <your_project_name>
$ cd <your_project_name>
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/<your_project_name>/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking! :-)
