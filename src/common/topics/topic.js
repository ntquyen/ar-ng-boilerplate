The fields that influence the name in TAM are Name (which could be full name, company name or partial of either), Attention (which is sometimes used for first name, sometimes used as a spillover field) and Heading.</p>\r\n<p>The issues with using TAM's customer level names fields are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There is no unique first name, last name or company field</li>\r\n<li>Those pieces of data are often stored in the generic \"name\" field</li>\r\n<li>That field is limited to 25 characters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">So, be default, we parse the Name field. If it's a commercial account, we map it to the Company field. If it's a personal account, we guess at which parts of the field are a First Name and Last Name and put them in the corresponding fields in the Engine.</span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><br /></span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">As a result of this, names are never perfect. It's impossible to perfectly parse the many variations of a full name into first name and last name.
